My girlfriend I struggle to find movies to watch, so this project is a simple movie recommendation app! This was built with Next JS, and utilizes the OMBDb Movie Database to extract movie information, such as title, year of release, poster images, among other information. This app works by returning a random list of movies to the user once they click the 'Let Us Choose For You' button in the center of the screen. I'm hoping to add more functionality to this app in the future!

(V.1.0.1)
- Completely mobile-responsive (finally.)
- Clicking on the movie takes you to a Google search of that movie so user can learn more about it.
